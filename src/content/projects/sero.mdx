A bill-splitting application designed for shared living situations where groceries and common expenses need regular distribution. When someone uploads a receipt, OCR extracts line items automatically. Each group member then claims the items they purchased through a two-phase workflow, distributing the coordination work across all participants instead of burdening a single person with itemization.

## Two-Phase Claiming System

The core innovation is a distributed claiming workflow that prevents coordination conflicts:

- **Phase 1 — Claiming Window** — After OCR processing completes, all group members receive notifications and can simultaneously claim their items from the extracted receipt. The system tracks all claim attempts in real-time.

- **Phase 2 — Confirmation** — Once claiming closes, participants review the distribution and confirm their amounts. This phase catches conflicts where multiple people claimed the same item or someone accidentally claimed the wrong thing.

This design eliminates the single-point-of-failure problem in traditional bill-splitting apps where one person has to remember everyone's purchases and manually assign each item.

## Technical Features

- **Bill State Machine** — Bills progress through five states (UPLOADED → OCR_PROCESSING → PHASE1_CLAIMING → PHASE2_CONFIRMATION → FINALIZED), ensuring data consistency during concurrent user interactions.

- **Real-time Collaboration** — Multiple users can claim items simultaneously while the system prevents conflicts through proper state management and validation rules.

- **Transparent Expense Tracking** — Complete claim history shows who claimed what items, confirmation status, and final calculated amounts with full audit trail.

- **Tax Distribution** — Proportional tax allocation based on claimed items ensures fair splitting of receipt subtotals and taxes.

## Architecture

The backend exposes RESTful API endpoints for authentication, group management, bill lifecycle operations, line item tracking, and claiming workflows. The data model tracks relationships between users, groups, bills, line items, and claims, with careful attention to state transitions and concurrent access patterns.

The frontend Progressive Web App provides a mobile-first experience that works across devices without app store distribution. React with Vite enables fast development iteration and optimal bundle sizes for mobile networks.

OCR integration evaluates multiple providers including Mindee, Veryfi, AWS Textract, and Google Cloud Vision, with a modular design that allows provider switching based on output quality.

## What I Built

I designed the complete system architecture including the bill state machine, two-phase claiming workflow, and API contracts. I implemented the database schema with proper relationship modeling for users, groups, bills, line items, and claims. The backend includes comprehensive REST endpoints for authentication, group operations, bill management, and the full claiming lifecycle with validation rules to prevent coordination conflicts.
