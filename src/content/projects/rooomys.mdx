Rooomys is a web application that connects users seeking compatible roommates through an interactive matching interface. The platform implements server-side rendering with Next.js App Router to deliver fast initial page loads and progressive enhancement for subsequent interactions. The architecture prioritizes performance through strategic component placement, with critical matching logic executed server-side while maintaining client-side responsiveness for user actions.

## Performance-Optimized Architecture

The application achieves sub-100ms response times through a combination of React Server Components and strategic caching. Server components handle data fetching and initial rendering on the server, eliminating client-side waterfalls and reducing time-to-interactive. The Next.js App Router provides automatic code splitting and prefetching, ensuring that navigation between profiles and match results happens near-instantaneously. Clerk's middleware integration handles authentication checks at the edge, adding minimal latency to protected routes while maintaining security.

## Technical Features

- **Type-Safe Database Layer** — Prisma ORM with TypeScript provides compile-time type checking for all database queries, eliminating runtime type errors and enabling IDE autocompletion for database operations.

- **Component-Driven UI Architecture** — Built with Radix UI primitives and shadcn/ui components, implementing accessible, composable UI elements following the compound component pattern.

- **Server-Side Authentication Flow** — Clerk middleware intercepts requests before they reach route handlers, validating JWT tokens at the edge for instant redirect behavior.

- **Progressive Enhancement Strategy** — Forms and interactions degrade gracefully when JavaScript is unavailable, with server actions handling submissions and optimistic updates when enhanced.

- **Custom Animation System** — Tailwind configuration extends default animation utilities with custom keyframes using CSS transforms and GPU acceleration for 60fps performance.

- **Modular Routing Architecture** — Next.js App Router organizes routes using file-system based routing with nested layouts and dynamic route segments.

## Architecture

The application follows a three-tier architecture with clear separation between presentation, business logic, and data persistence. Client components handle user input and manage local state, communicating with server components through React Server Component boundaries. Server components execute database queries through Prisma, which translates TypeScript-defined models into parameterized SQL queries. Clerk's session management integrates with Next.js middleware to protect routes, while webhook handlers synchronize authentication events with the Prisma database.

{/* ## What I Built

I implemented the complete authentication flow using Clerk, configuring middleware to protect routes while maintaining performance through edge-based session validation. I built the component library integration using shadcn/ui, customizing Radix UI primitives with Tailwind CSS to create reusable form controls, dialogs, and navigation components. I established the database schema using Prisma, defining user models and relationships that support the matching algorithm's data requirements, and configured the development environment with TypeScript strict mode and ESLint for type-safe development. */}
